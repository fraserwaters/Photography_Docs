# My Basic Photography Workflow

## Shoot

## Remove from the camera using a card reader

- Use Import folder on desktop
- Apply filename in import - FWaters-YYYYMMDD-FileNumberFromCamera
- Apply basic metadata at import - "holiday" "family" "kids" "dog" "race" "mtb" "cx" "road" "roadtrip" etc
- Copyright info
- Each project or shoot uses the following folder structure
    - PhotoLibrary
        - Catalog
        - Images
            - Year
                - Shoot Date - YYMMDD with optional description
                    - sub folders for RAW, TIFF and Done

## Backup the RAW files as importing

- Use external Drive with same folder structure

## Delete from SD Card

##  Processing in Lightroom

- Use a slideshow to rate each shot.
    - Assign Pick or Reject on folder
    - Round 2 assign star ratings
- Delete the rubbish

## Edit in LRoom/PShop etc

- Start editing highest rated images first
- Colour correction & Exposure tweeks
- Crop to 10x8
- Save each file as a TIFF
- Create JPG's for upload etc.
- Backup JPG's
