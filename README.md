# My Basic Photography Workflow

- Shoot
- Remove from the camera using a card reader
- Each project or shoot uses the following folder structure
    - specific folder in Photos directory
        - sub folders for RAW, TIFF and Done
- Backup the RAW files as importing
- RAW processing in Lightroom or Adobe Camera Raw
    - Use a slideshow to rate each shot.
    - Delete the rubbish
    - Colour correction & Exposure tweeks
    - Crop to 10x8
    - Save each file as a TIFF
- Edit any further in Photoshop???????
- Create JPG's for upload etc.
- Backup JPG's
